title: "Support intake — engineering"
order: 30
---

How the support window in [t3000-support-intake.md](./t3000-support-intake.md) is actually built: the stack, the contract between the two processes, and the method for each part. The intake document decides *what* exists; this one decides *how*.

Every technology named here is already in the repository it belongs to. Nothing new is added to any of the three products except source files.

---

## 1. The stack at a glance

| Layer | Language | Runtime and libraries already present | What it owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T3000 shell** | C++14 (MFC) | CMake, `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14`, WebView2 `1.0.1150.38` (x86), jsoncpp (`Json-cpp/include`), GDI+ (`mygdiplus.h`) | capture, context, logs, outbox, handoff, crash marker |
| **T3000 web UI** | TypeScript 5.8, React 18.3 | Vite under Quasar 2, React Router 6.22, Fluent UI v9 (`@fluentui/react-components`), Vitest | the Support page: four steps, annotation, Help & Learn |
| **T3000 local service** | Rust | axum 0.7, tokio, tokio-tungstenite, rusqlite — HTTP on 9103, WebSocket on 9104 | serves the bundle; already the localhost origin the window is loaded from |
| **Temco Platform** | TypeScript | VS Code workbench fork, the `src/temco` shell (43 KB), `temco-*` extensions with webview panels | the inbox, the issue draft, the forum draft |
| **Temco Learn** | Markdown, DocFX | the site's own generator | the forum topic, after approval |
| **Automation** | YAML + shell | GitHub Actions, `GITHUB_TOKEN` only | labels, dedupe, one comment, the docs-owed flag |

Three languages, and each is already the language of the thing it runs in. There is no fourth runtime to install, and no new dependency in any manifest.

---

## 2. Why each language sits where it does

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| why is the capture C++? | it is the only process that owns the window handle, the log paths and the device list. A page cannot photograph its own host |
| why is the window a React page? | the app already ships a React 18 + Fluent UI surface (`t3-react`), with the Documentation page as the working precedent |
| why is the queue in the platform, in TypeScript? | it is a webview panel in a module that already exists; a support inbox is another panel, not another program |
| why is there no server? | every path in the intake document finishes at GitHub's own form or its API, and both accept a request from a browser or a workflow |
| why is the local Rust service not used for capture? | it has no window handle. It stays the origin that serves the page, which is what it already is |

---

## 3. The message contract

### 3.1 The envelope that already exists

The page and the shell do not trade free text. `HandleWebViewMsg` (`T3000/BacnetWebView.cpp`) parses a JSON object, switches on an **integer** `action`, and echoes the caller's `msgId` back:

```json
{ "action": 41, "msgId": "7" }
```

The reply carries the action name plus `_RES`:

```json
{ "action": "SUPPORT_CAPTURE_RES", "msgId": "7", "ok": true, "path": "D:\\T3000\\Database\\Support\\2026-11-12T09-11-42\\window.png", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "bytes": 421888 }
```

So the support messages are **new enumerators on the existing enum**, appended at the end so no existing number moves:

```cpp
enum WEBVIEW_MESSAGE_TYPE
{
	// ... every existing entry, unchanged ...
	SUPPORT_CONTEXT = 100,
	SUPPORT_CAPTURE,
	SUPPORT_LOGS,
	SUPPORT_SETTINGS,
	SUPPORT_CLIPBOARD,
	SUPPORT_HANDOFF,
	SUPPORT_OPEN_URL,
	SUPPORT_OUTBOX,
	SUPPORT_OUTBOX_RES,
};
```

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| append, never renumber | the numbers are the wire format, and an old bundle with a new EXE must not call the wrong handler |
| every reply is `{ action: "X_RES", msgId, ok }` | the channel is shared with the rest of the app; a reply without an id cannot be matched to its request |
| `ok: false` carries `error` and never a stack | the page shows one sentence and the reason code |
| the page feature-detects by *asking*, not by version | a bundle can be newer than the EXE; a missing action answers `ok: false, error: "unknown_action"` and the page hides what needs it |

### 3.2 The eight messages

| Action | Request fields | Reply |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPPORT_CONTEXT` | — | `version`, `build`, `os`, `locale`, `screen`, `panels[]` (each `name`, `firmware`, `product`) |
| `SUPPORT_CAPTURE` | `mode`: `whole` \| `client` \| `screen` | `path`, `width`, `height`, `bytes` |
| `SUPPORT_LOGS` | `lines` (default 200) | `path`, `bytes`, `dropped` (lines removed at the top) |
| `SUPPORT_SETTINGS` | — | `path`, `bytes`, or `ok: false, error: "withheld"` |
| `SUPPORT_CLIPBOARD` | `path` | `ok` — whether the PNG reached the clipboard |
| `SUPPORT_HANDOFF` | `bundle` (folder), `summary` | `ok`, `route`: `platform` \| `browser` |
| `SUPPORT_OPEN_URL` | `url` (https only) | `ok` |
| `SUPPORT_OUTBOX` | `op`: `save` \| `list` \| `send` \| `delete`, `bundle` | `items[]` for `list`; `ok` otherwise |

### 3.3 Threading, and the one trap

`HandleWebViewMsg` runs on the UI thread holding `handleWebViewMsgMutex`. A capture takes tens of milliseconds and the log copy takes more. So:

- the **reply is built after the work**, but the work itself is dispatched to a worker thread and the reply posted back with `PostWebMessageAsJson` when it finishes — the page is already written against a promise with a timeout (§5.3), so a slower reply costs nothing;
- the capture **must** run on the thread that owns the window, because `PrintWindow` needs the window's message loop to be answering — so the pump is kept free by not blocking the lock: capture on the UI thread but outside `handleWebViewMsgMutex`;
- the log and settings copies are plain file I/O and run on any thread.

---

## 4. The five host methods

Each one is a small function in one new translation unit. Nothing else in `T3000/` changes.

### 4.1 Capture — `SupportCapture.cpp`

The whole method is: get the window's real rectangle, ask it to paint itself into a memory DC with the full-content flag, encode with GDI+, save.

```cpp
bool CaptureWindow(HWND hwnd, const std::wstring& path, int& width, int& height)
{
	RECT frame = {};
	if (FAILED(DwmGetWindowAttribute(hwnd, DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS, &frame, sizeof(frame)))) {
		GetWindowRect(hwnd, &frame);
	}
	width = frame.right - frame.left;
	height = frame.bottom - frame.top;
	if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) {
		return false;
	}

	HDC screen = GetDC(nullptr);
	HDC memory = CreateCompatibleDC(screen);
	HBITMAP dib = CreateCompatibleBitmap(screen, width, height);
	HGDIOBJ previous = SelectObject(memory, dib);

	const BOOL painted = PrintWindow(hwnd, memory, PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT);

	CLSID png;
	CLSIDFromString(L"{557CF406-1A04-11D3-9A73-0000F81EF32E}", &png);
	Gdiplus::Bitmap bitmap(dib, nullptr);
	const Gdiplus::Status saved = bitmap.Save(path.c_str(), &png, nullptr);

	SelectObject(memory, previous);
	DeleteObject(dib);
	DeleteDC(memory);
	ReleaseDC(nullptr, screen);
	return painted && saved == Gdiplus::Ok;
}
```

| Detail | Decision |
|---|---|
| the flag | `PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT` (`0x2`) is what makes a WebView2 child appear at all; without it the pane is black |
| the rectangle | `DwmGetWindowAttribute(DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS)` excludes the invisible resize border and keeps a multi-monitor window on its own monitor; `GetWindowRect` is the fallback |
| DPI | the app declares no DPI awareness — no manifest entry and no `SetProcessDpiAwareness` call — so the rectangle it reports is already in the pixels it draws in. The capture therefore never rescales, and the page is told the pixel size it received |
| the encoder | GDI+ is already linked and used (`Gdiplus::Font` in `BacnetGraphic.cpp`); PNG needs no new library |
| the cap | if the long edge exceeds 2560 px, scale once with `Gdiplus::Bitmap::GetThumbnailImage` and re-encode |
| where it saves | `<exe>\Database\Support\<timestamp>\window.png`, beside the app's own data (`g_strExePth`), never `%TEMP%` — plant PCs clean `%TEMP%` and support loses the file |
| black output | if more than 99 % of pixels are one colour, capture again with `client` mode and report `ok: false, error: "capture_blank"` rather than sending a black image |

New link dependency: `dwmapi.lib` for the frame bounds. One line in `CMakeLists.txt`, next to the WebView2 loader.

### 4.2 Context — `SupportContext.cpp`

Read, do not compute: the version from the app's own version resource, the screen name from the frame's current view, the panels from the already-loaded device list in memory.

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `version`, `build` | the executable's `VS_VERSIONINFO`, as About already reads it |
| `os`, `locale` | `RtlGetVersion` and `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` — not `GetVersionEx`, which lies without a manifest |
| `screen` | the frame's active view title, which the page can cross-check against its own route |
| `panels[]` | the same list the webview is already given by `GET_PANELS_LIST`, filtered to those with data on screen |

The reply is capped at 4 KB. A panel name is user data, so the field is `name` and nothing else is read from the device.

### 4.3 Logs — `SupportLog.cpp`

Read the tail, do not load the file: seek to `max(0, size - 512 KB)`, discard the first partial line, keep the last 200 lines, write UTF-8, cap at 256 KB, and record how many lines were discarded in `dropped`.

| Detail | Decision |
|---|---|
| encoding | the app's logs are locale-encoded; the excerpt is converted to UTF-8 once, so the page never guesses |
| redaction | the excerpt is **not** rewritten — the review panel (§8.7 of the intake) shows it whole and lets the person remove the attachment |
| failure | a missing log is `ok: true` with `path: null` and `bytes: 0`, not an error: a report without logs is still a report |

### 4.4 Outbox — `SupportOutbox.cpp`

A report is a folder, so it survives a crash between any two writes:

```json
{
  "id": "2026-11-12T09-11-42",
  "created": "2026-11-12T09:11:42Z",
  "title": "Trendlog graph is empty after I picked 6 points",
  "kind": "bug",
  "state": "queued",
  "files": ["window.png", "t3000-2026-11-12.log"],
  "context": { "version": "2026.0912", "screen": "Devices > Trendlogs" }
}
```

| Operation | Method |
|---|---|
| `save` | write `report.json.tmp`, flush, rename to `report.json` — a rename is atomic on NTFS, so a half-written report is never listed |
| `list` | enumerate `<exe>\Database\Support\*` for folders with a `report.json`; ignore the rest |
| `send` | the same handoff as `SUPPORT_HANDOFF`, then `state: "sent"` |
| `delete` | delete the folder, then report the new list |

A `state` field rather than a move, so a folder never disappears under a running send.

### 4.5 Handoff — `SupportHandoff.cpp`

One function, two routes, and the second is not a fallback in the apologetic sense — it is the normal path on a machine without the platform:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | `ShellExecuteEx` with `temco-platform://support/new?bundle=<url-encoded folder>` |
| 2 | `ShellExecuteEx` returns a value above 32 when the protocol is registered; anything else means no handler |
| 3 | on no handler: put the PNG on the clipboard as `CF_DIB`, then open `reportIssueUrl` with `?title=` and `?body=` prefilled |
| 4 | reply `route: "platform"` or `route: "browser"`, so the page can say which one happened |

| Detail | Decision |
|---|---|
| no shell injection | the URL is built from a fixed scheme, a fixed path and one percent-encoded local path. No user text reaches the command line |
| the clipboard | `CF_DIB` (not `CF_HDROP`) — a browser accepts a pasted DIB into a file input, and GitHub's attachment box is a file input |
| the size | a prefilled GitHub URL cannot carry a 400 KB image; the URL carries text only, and the image travels by clipboard |

### 4.6 The crash marker

`SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` writes one small file before the process dies, and the next start reads it.

```json
{ "fingerprint": "0xC0000005:trendlog+0x1f42", "first": "2026-11-12T09:11:03Z", "count": 1, "log": "t3000-2026-11-12.log" }
```

| Detail | Decision |
|---|---|
| the fingerprint | exception code plus module and offset — stable across runs, distinct across faults, which is what `Do not ask again` needs |
| what the handler writes | 200 bytes, with `CreateFileW(..., FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH)`. It does **not** read the log, build JSON with jsoncpp, or allocate: a handler that allocates can fault again |
| the full dump | left to Windows Error Reporting's `LocalDumps` key, configured by the installer, not by the app |
| the counter | `count` is why the third crash of the same fault is reported without asking again |

---

## 5. The Support page

### 5.1 Where it goes

The app already carries a React surface, so the window is a feature folder, not a new app:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/t3-react/features/support/pages/SupportPage.tsx` | the window: header, rail, step content |
| `src/t3-react/features/support/components/` | `ScreenshotStep`, `AnnotationCanvas`, `DetailsStep`, `ReviewStep`, `SentStep`, `OutboxStep`, `HelpSearch` |
| `src/t3-react/features/support/services/supportBridge.ts` | the promise layer over the message contract (§5.3) |
| `src/t3-react/features/support/support.css` or `.module.css` | Fluent tokens only; no hard-coded colour |
| `src/t3-react/app/router/routes.ts` | one lazy route, in the same table as `DocumentationPage` |

The route is registered exactly like the Documentation page is: `lazy()` import, inside the existing router table. No new build target, no new entry point — `npm run build` in the web project picks it up, and `npm run deploy:t3000` copies the result into `T3000/ResourceFile/webview/www` as it does today.

### 5.2 Components, not inventions

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| buttons, fields, dropdowns, badges | `@fluentui/react-components` — already a dependency, and it is the same design system the Documentation page uses |
| light and dark | the app's `theme` folder and its existing Fluent theme provider |
| icons | `@fluentui/react-icons`, already a dependency |
| the step rail | a `<nav>` with `aria-current="step"`; no custom list widget |
| the annotation surface | one `<canvas>` with pointer events; `fabric` and `paper` are already in the app, but plain canvas is enough and is 200 lines |
| translation | the app's existing i18n pipeline (XLIFF, `xliff` is already a dependency); no second translation system |

### 5.3 The bridge

One module, one function, and the page never posts a raw message anywhere else:

```ts
type Reply = { msgId?: string; ok?: boolean; action?: string; error?: string; [key: string]: unknown };

const pending = new Map<string, (reply: Reply) => void>();
let sequence = 0;

export function request(action: number, fields: Record<string, unknown> = {}, timeoutMs = 8000): Promise<Reply> {
	const msgId = String(++sequence);
	return new Promise<Reply>((resolve, reject) => {
		const timer = setTimeout(() => {
			pending.delete(msgId);
			reject(new Error('bridge_timeout'));
		}, timeoutMs);
		pending.set(msgId, reply => {
			clearTimeout(timer);
			pending.delete(msgId);
			resolve(reply);
		});
		window.chrome.webview.postMessage(JSON.stringify({ action, msgId, ...fields }));
	});
}

window.chrome.webview.addEventListener('message', event => {
	const reply = typeof event.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(event.data) as Reply : event.data as Reply;
	if (reply.msgId) {
		pending.get(reply.msgId)?.(reply);
	}
});
```

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| every call has a timeout | a handler that throws must not leave a spinner forever |
| `request` is the only writer to `chrome.webview` | the channel is shared with the rest of the app, and a second writer means two listeners and duplicate replies |
| no reply is trusted for shape | the reply is parsed and its fields are checked before use, because it crosses a process boundary |
| the browser build still loads | `window.chrome?.webview` is undefined in a browser; the module exposes `isHosted()` and the page runs read-only in a browser for development |

### 5.4 The annotation canvas

| Step | Method |
|---|---|
| load | `request(SUPPORT_CAPTURE, { mode })` → a path → `<img src>` served by the local Rust origin, or the host's own `file://`-equivalent route |
| draw | keep a base image and a list of annotations `{ tool, from, to, width }`; redraw on every pointer move (60 fps on a 1600 × 900 canvas is not a problem) |
| redact | fill the rectangle with black **on the export canvas**, not only on screen; the exported PNG has no pixels there |
| export | `canvas.toBlob('image/png')`, then hand the blob back to the host as a path — the host writes it, because the page cannot write to disk |
| undo | pop the annotation list; the base image is never mutated |

The one rule that is not negotiable: **redaction happens before the file is exported**, so no un-redacted copy exists on disk.

### 5.5 Help & Learn and the offline copy

The window is loaded from `http://localhost:9103`, which is served by the Rust service that is already running. So the help copy is:

| Piece | Method |
|---|---|
| the copy | the site's content package, unpacked beside the app during install — the same tree the site is generated from |
| search | an index built at bundle time (DocFX already emits one); the page filters it in memory, which is why search works with no network |
| the online half | `SUPPORT_OPEN_URL` opens the real site in the browser |
| if the service is down | the page loads from the bundle's own files (`chrome-extension://`-style local origin) and hides search; the report half still works |

---

## 6. The platform surfaces

| Surface | Where | Method |
|---|---|---|
| the protocol handler | `src/temco/platform/` (one file, one registration) | `IURLService.registerHandler` with an `IURLHandler` whose `handleURL` claims `support` + `/new` and executes a command |
| the inbox panel | `extensions/temco-workbench/src/support.ts` | `vscode.window.createWebviewPanel`, in the same shape as `dashboard.ts` — one panel map, one `open()` |
| the issue draft | the panel writes `draft.md` | a `WorkspaceEdit`, so the draft is a real file a person can read, diff and copy |
| the forum draft | the panel, after an approval | nothing is posted; the panel shows the text as it would appear |

```ts
class SupportUrlHandler implements IURLHandler {
	constructor(private readonly commandService: ICommandService) { }

	async handleURL(uri: URI): Promise<boolean> {
		if (uri.authority !== 'support' || uri.path !== '/new') {
			return false;
		}
		const bundle = new URLSearchParams(uri.query).get('bundle') ?? undefined;
		await this.commandService.executeCommand('temcoWorkbench.support.open', bundle);
		return true;
	}
}
```

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| the handler **returns `false`** for any other URL | a protocol handler that swallows every `temco-platform://` URL breaks the app's own links |
| the bundle path is treated as untrusted | it arrives from another process. It is resolved, must be inside the app's `Database\Support` folder, and its files are read with a size cap; nothing is executed and nothing is extracted |
| the panel loads no remote content | a strict CSP, a nonce for the one inline script, and images only through `asWebviewUri` |
| one command, one panel | reopening the same bundle focuses the existing tab rather than opening a second copy |

---

## 7. Automation

| Piece | Method |
|---|---|
| the workflow | `.github/workflows/support-triage.yml`, `on: issues: [opened, edited]`, `permissions: issues: write` |
| the token | `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` only. No PAT, no app key, no repository secret to rotate |
| classify | a table in the workflow: label keywords → `area:trendlogs`, `area:bacnet`, `area:graphics`; the issue template's own labels do the type |
| dedupe | `gh issue list --search "<two distinctive words>" --state all`, then link the closest rather than guess |
| the comment | one comment, posted once, with an `<!-- support-triage -->` marker so a re-run edits instead of stacking |
| the draft | a Copilot/LLM step only when a repository variable enables it; the fallback is the same comment without prose |
| docs-owed | when the body names a help page id, add `docs-owed`; that label already exists for the site's own checks |
| the forum | never automated. The draft is approved by a person (§9.3 of the intake) |

---

## 8. Nothing new is installed

| Layer | New dependency |
|---|---|
| C++ | `dwmapi.lib` — a Windows SDK import library, not a package |
| web UI | none: React, Fluent UI, Router, Vitest and canvas are all present |
| Rust | none: the service is unchanged, and no support route is added to it in phase 1 or 2 |
| platform | none: `IURLService`, webview panels and the command registry are the fork's own |
| automation | none: `gh` is preinstalled on GitHub's runners |

If a later phase wants one-click anonymous filing (§13 of the intake), the smallest addition is a single Cloudflare Worker or Azure Function — not a service in this repository, and not a token in the client.

---

## 9. Failure modes and what the user sees

| Failure | Detection | What the page does |
|---|---|---|
| the web bundle is newer than the EXE | `SUPPORT_CONTEXT` answers `unknown_action` | hides the capture step, keeps the form, hands off through the browser route |
| the capture is black | the host's pixel check | says so, offers `client` mode, and offers the whole-screen capture |
| the log is missing | `path: null` | the attachment is absent from the review, with one line saying why |
| no platform installed | `ShellExecuteEx` ≤ 32 | the browser route, with the clipboard message |
| no connection | the page's own `navigator.onLine` and the first failed handoff | saves to the outbox and says when it will leave |
| the outbox is full | more than 20 queued reports | refuses a new save and offers to send or delete |
| the local service is down | the page's fetch fails | renders from bundled files, search hidden, report intact |
| the platform is given a bad bundle | the path escapes the support folder, or a file is over the cap | the panel shows the problem and offers the log, and posts nothing |

Every one of these is a sentence in the window, not a dialog with an error code.

---

## 10. Budget

| Thing | Target | Why |
|---|---|---|
| the page's own assets | ≤ 40 KB gzipped | it joins a 33 MB bundle; this is noise, and a feature folder that pulls in a chart library would not be |
| cold open | ≤ 200 ms on a 1366 × 768 plant PC | it opens from localhost, with no network |
| the capture | ≤ 120 ms for a 1600 × 900 window | it runs on the UI thread |
| the PNG | ≤ 1.5 MB, long edge ≤ 2560 px | it is pasted into a browser or attached to an issue |
| the bundle | ≤ 2 MB zipped | the outbox is a folder on a plant PC's disk |
| the platform panel | ≤ 150 ms to first paint | it reads one folder of local files |

---

## 11. How each part ships

| Artifact | Built by | Reaches the customer by |
|---|---|---|
| `T3000.exe` with the support module | CMake, the existing target — one added source file and `dwmapi.lib` | the existing installer |
| the web bundle with the Support page | `npm run build` in the web project, then `npm run deploy:t3000` | the same bundle path the Documentation page already uses, and T3000's own updater |
| the offline help copy | the site's content package | the installer |
| the platform panel | the extension build | the platform's normal release |
| the workflow | committed YAML | takes effect on merge |

The only version handshake is the one the page performs itself: it asks the host what it can do and adapts. There is no separate protocol version to keep in step.

---

## 12. Work breakdown

In the order that keeps every step shippable.

| # | Task | Where | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SUPPORT_CONTEXT` and `SUPPORT_HANDOFF`, browser route only | `T3000/Support*.cpp`, `BacnetWebView.cpp` | Help ▸ Report an Issue opens GitHub with the title prefilled |
| 2 | `SUPPORT_CAPTURE` and `SUPPORT_CLIPBOARD` | `T3000/SupportCapture.cpp`, `dwmapi.lib` | the screenshot pastes into the issue body from the clipboard |
| 3 | the Support page, steps 1–4, no annotation | `src/t3-react/features/support/` | a report is written in the window and handed off |
| 4 | the annotation canvas and redaction | the same folder | a redacted area is gone from the exported PNG |
| 5 | `SUPPORT_LOGS`, `SUPPORT_SETTINGS` and the review panel | C++ and the page | an attachment can be read and removed before sending |
| 6 | the outbox | `SupportOutbox.cpp` | a report written offline leaves on the next start |
| 7 | the crash marker and the next-start prompt | `SupportCrash.cpp` | a killed process produces one prompt, fingerprinted |
| 8 | Help & Learn over the offline copy | the page, and the installer's copy | search answers with the network off |
| 9 | the protocol handler and the inbox panel | `src/temco`, `extensions/temco-workbench` | a bundle opens as a tab, and the reply is copied by hand |
| 10 | the triage workflow | `.github/workflows/support-triage.yml` | a new issue is labelled and answered once |

---

## 13. Validation

| Layer | What proves it |
|---|---|
| C++ | a `support-selftest` switch that captures the main window and writes a PNG, run by hand on a Windows build; the log reader and the outbox have plain unit tests |
| the page | Vitest, already configured: the bridge's promise, timeout and unknown-action behaviour; the redaction export |
| the platform | the existing test harness with a fake `IURLService`, and a bundle-path rejection test |
| the docs | `npm run check-temco-docs`, which already runs in `npm run check-temco` |
| the end to end | a scripted Windows run: open T3000, trigger a report, confirm the issue opens with title and body, and the clipboard holds the PNG |
