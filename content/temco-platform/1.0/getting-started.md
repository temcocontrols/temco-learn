**Temco Platform is where product documentation is written and published.** It is a desktop application, built on VS Code. In it you write pages and group them into a **project**. You then build that project into a website, with a printable PDF and a Windows help file, and publish the result to **Temco Learn**: the documentation site readers actually open, at `https://temcocontrols.github.io/temco-learn/`.

This guide walks that whole journey once, from an empty folder to a live page. It assumes you have never opened the application before, and it assumes no background in VS Code, in Git, or in the site's own code. Where one of those cannot be avoided — a commit, a catalog — it is explained at the step where you meet it.

## The 30-second version

- **What it is:** you write pages in a project, build them into a site, and publish that site to Temco Learn.
- **What it needs:** the application, Node 22, a clone of the site with its dependencies installed, and permission to push to `temcocontrols/temco-learn`.
- **What you run:** `temcoDocs.buildSite`, then `temcoLearn.addBuild`, then `temcoLearn.site.downloads`, then `temcoLearn.publish`.
- **What you get:** your project on `temcocontrols.github.io/temco-learn/`, under Documentation, with one version for each build you add.

Read steps 1–9 the first time through. After that, everything you need day to day is in [Running it again](#running-it-again).

## The two halves

Temco Platform and Temco Learn are two halves of one idea, and they meet in a single place: a copy of a project's build.

```text
you, writing          Temco Platform              the site clone            Temco Learn
a page          →      builds and publishes  →     one commit on main   →    what a reader opens
```

| | **Temco Platform** | **Temco Learn** |
|---|---|---|
| is | the **authoring** application, a desktop app built on VS Code | the **published** site, a static React app on GitHub Pages |
| is for | whoever writes, reviews and owns product documentation | whoever reads it: customers, field engineers, support |
| what you do there | create a project, write pages, build, make the downloads, publish | read, search, switch versions, download the PDF or the help file |
| what it holds | your project folder, and the site clone it publishes into | one imported build per version, the catalog, the downloads |
| where it lives | the application on your machine | its own repository, `~/temco/temco-learn`, deployed by CI |

You only need the left-hand column to finish this guide. The right-hand one is what gives the work its point, and it is also the reason there is a step that produces a PDF by hand: the site cannot make one for you.

## What you see when you open Temco Platform

The activity bar on the left holds eight areas. This guide uses four of them, and it is worth knowing what the other four are before they surprise you.

| Area | Holds | In this guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | Overview, Projects, What needs doing | step 2: where a project is created |
| **Documentation** | Project, Pages, Publish | steps 3 and 4: the pages, and the build |
| **Repositories** | Sources: organisations, clones, the folder settings | step 1: the folders everything lands in |
| **Temco Learn** | Overview, Site, Artifacts | steps 6 to 9: add, downloads, preview, publish |
| **AI** | Draft, What it does, Server, Tools | Beyond the flow: drafts beside your text |
| **Forum** | Browse | not covered here |
| **Tools** | Studios: SQL, network, BACnet, devices | not covered here |
| **Settings** | General, Modules, AI Runtime, Branding, Publishing | step 1, and the Repositories page above |

If you cannot find something in the activity bar, you can still reach it by name: the [appendix](#appendix--every-button-one-page) lists every control together with the command id behind it.

## What a reader sees on Temco Learn

It is worth seeing this once, so that you know what you are aiming at.

| The reader opens | And gets |
|---|---|
| the home page | the site's sections as tiles; Documentation is where your project will appear |
| a section | the projects filed under it, each with its title and summary |
| a project | its versions — every version you add is a separate entry, never an overwrite |
| a version | that version's pages, in the reading order the registry gives them |
| a page | the page itself, a download menu for the PDF, the help file and the Markdown, and a way to say it was wrong |

None of this is a separate publishing channel. The site reads one catalog, and that catalog is what step 6 writes.

## Who this is for

| If you are… | this guide gets you to |
|---|---|
| **writing documentation** for a Temco product (T3000, a controller, a protocol) | a project of your own, built and live under Documentation on the site |
| **taking over documentation that already exists** — a folder of Markdown, a Word manual, a compiled `.chm` | the same result, starting from *Import a document set* in step 2, with your existing pages converted once |
| **working inside a product repository** that already has `docs/` and its own build scripts | the same result, with your repository's own `docs:site` or `build:help:dry` scripts doing the building instead of the built-in generator |
| **reviewing someone else's documentation** | enough of the flow to read what they changed, and to publish it |

You do not have to be the person who set the machine up. If somebody else did, [Before the first time](#before-the-first-time) shows you how to check that the three settings and the site clone are right before you begin.

## How to use this guide

- **Read steps 1–9 in order, once.** After that, go straight to [Running it again](#running-it-again); that is what everyday work looks like.
- **Every step has the same three parts:** what you do, **You should see** (a file or a screen to check), and **If not** (the usual cause). If the file a step promises is not there, that is the step that failed, and nothing after it is worth testing yet.
- **Buttons are named as they appear**, with the command id in backticks beside them, like `temcoDocs.buildSite`. If a button is hidden or unavailable, type that id into the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and it will run the same action.
- **A `~` in a path means your home folder.** Windows paths are written with backslashes; on macOS and Linux the same path uses `/`. The only genuinely Windows-only piece is the `.chm`, which needs the help compiler.
- **Keep this guide open in a second window** while you work through it. It is meant to be read next to the application, not memorised.

## What you need before you start

| Need | Why |
|---|---|
| the application installed and running | this guide is about using it, not installing it |
| write access to the `temcocontrols/temco-learn` repository, or someone who has it | the last step pushes a commit there. Without access, everything before it still works and simply stops at *publish* |
| git configured with your GitHub account | a publish is a `git add`, a `commit` and a `push`, all under your name |
| the site clone on this machine | `~/temco/temco-learn` unless you choose otherwise. The Site page clones it for you |
| an hour for the first run | steps 2 and 7 account for most of it |
| rather less every time after | a repeat publish is four commands and about two minutes |

## What you are making

Five things take part. Knowing which is which is most of understanding the flow.

| Thing | Is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **A project** | one body of documentation: its name, its pages, and the outputs it should produce | `<projectsFolder>/<slug>/`, for example `~/temco/projects/t3000` |
| **A page** | one Markdown file, listed in the project's registry | `<project>/docs/<area>/*.md`, with the list in `docs/help/registry.json` |
| **A picture** | a screenshot or diagram a page points at — `![the trend log](media/x.png)` | `<project>/docs/media/`. The build copies everything under `docs/` that is not a page, so a picture keeps the address the page gave it |
| **A build** | the rendered site, made from those pages | `<project>/dist/site`, or `dist/docs` when your own generator wrote it |
| **The site** | the Temco Learn repository: a React app that reads a catalog of projects | `temcoLearn.siteRepo`, by default `~/temco/temco-learn` |
| **The published page** | what a reader opens on the internet | GitHub Pages, served from the site's `main` branch |

The first three are yours and stay yours. The site is its own repository, and the last one belongs to GitHub. That split is why the flow has separate steps instead of one button, and why each step can fail in its own way.

## The general flow

There are four acts and three places. You write and build inside **your project**. The site clone takes one version, plus its downloads. A publish puts that on **GitHub**, and the site's own CI serves it to readers.

```text
YOUR PROJECT              ──▶ THE SITE CLONE             ──▶ GITHUB, THEN READERS
write, then build             add, then the downloads        publish, then CI deploys
~/temco/projects/t3000        ~/temco/temco-learn            temcocontrols/temco-learn
```

| Act | Command | Writes | What a reader would notice |
|---|---|---|---|
| write | the editor, `temcoDocs.newPage` | `docs/**/*.md`, `docs/help/registry.json` | nothing |
| build | `temcoDocs.buildSite` | `<project>/dist/site` | nothing yet: nobody can see it |
| add | `temcoLearn.addBuild` | `public/imported/<id>/<version>/`, `content/<id>/site.json` | nothing yet, though it previews at `localhost` |
| make the downloads | `temcoLearn.site.downloads` | `public/pdf/…`, `public/chm/…`, the download manifest | nothing yet, but the deploy would refuse without them |
| publish | `temcoLearn.publish`, then *Publish* | one commit, one push | a minute later, the page is live |

The nine steps below are this table with the details filled in.

So the flow can stop in four places. Each is named at the step it belongs to: a build with no `index.html` to add, a site clone that is not where the setting says, a catalog that could not run, and a version whose PDF is missing. The last is the one people run into most often, which is why it has a step and a test of its own.

## Words this guide uses

The platform uses a few words that mean something more specific than they do elsewhere. One pass over this table saves a lot of guessing later.

| Word | Means |
|---|---|
| **registry** | `docs/help/registry.json`, the list of every page: its title, where it sits, whether it ships. The application reads it, and a build renders it |
| **area** | the top level of the documentation, one per product or section, declared in the registry |
| **chapter** | the folder a page sits in, inside an area |
| **page id** | the page's path under `docs/` without the `.md`: the id `t3000/commissioning/ports` is the file `docs/t3000/commissioning/ports.md` |
| **build** | the rendered site produced from the pages, in `<project>/dist/site` |
| **version** | one fixed entry of a project on the site, such as `1.0` or `1.1`. A rebuild becomes a new version rather than overwriting an old one. It becomes a folder and an address (`/t3000/1.0/`), so it is typed in digits — `1.0`, `17.4`, or a dated edition `2026.01` — never `v1.0` |
| **section** | the category a project appears under on the site: `documentation`, `training`, `tests`, `products`, `qa` or `topics` |
| **catalog** | `public/catalog.json` in the site, the one file the site's app reads to know what exists |
| **downloads** | the PDFs and help files the site serves. The deploy cannot build them, so they are made on your machine and committed |
| **guard** | the site's own check that every catalogued version has its downloads. CI runs it, and so does a publish before it commits |

## What you will have when you are done

- T3000 listed under **Documentation** on the site, with its own card, icon and description.
- Every version you added, each one selectable (`1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0`) with its own pages.
- A **Downloads** menu for each version: the whole-guide PDF, and a Windows help file when one could be compiled.
- Your pages in the site's search index.
- One commit on `main` in the site repository, and a green GitHub Actions run that deployed it.

## Before the first time

The table above is about *you*: the application, access, an hour. This one is about the **machine**, and it happens once. If somebody else set the machine up, work down the list and confirm each line rather than assuming.

| Do this once | Why |
|---|---|
| Node 22 or newer on your path (`node --version`) | the site's own scripts run with `--experimental-strip-types` |
| Have the site clone. The Site page (**Open the Site Page**) clones `temcocontrols/temco-learn` for you | the site is its own repository, and this application is a client of it |
| `cd ~/temco/temco-learn && npm ci` | the site's dependencies, once per clone |
| `npx playwright install chromium` | the PDFs are printed by a browser. Without it, *Make the Downloads* tells you so |
| Optionally, HTML Help Workshop | a `.chm` needs `hhc.exe`. Without it, the site simply has no help file |

Three of those five are optional in practice: a site without PDFs still builds and previews, and a site without a help file is still a site. Node and `npm ci` are not optional. Without them the site's `catalog` cannot run, and step 6 will stop there.

## Where things go

Three settings decide every path in this guide. Set them once. Every page reads them back, so you can check the answer rather than the field.

| Setting | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `temcoRepositories.workspaceFolder` | Settings ▸ Repositories ▸ Working folder | the working area. Clones go to `<it>/source/<repository>` |
| `temcoRepositories.projectsFolder` | Settings ▸ Repositories ▸ Projects folder | a project's own folder is made at `<it>/<slug>` |
| `temcoLearn.siteRepo` | the Site page ▸ **Choose the Site Folder**, or the setting | the site clone: `~/temco/temco-learn` unless you say otherwise |

`temcoWorkbench.publishing.site` is not one of these. It is an address shown on the Publishing page, not a folder.

## Step 1 — check the folders

Open **Settings ▸ Repositories** and read the two sentences under the fields, not the fields themselves. The page reads your saved settings, so those sentences are the honest answer to "where will this go?".

> **Screenshot — the Repositories settings page, with “Clones land in …” and “Projects are made in …” visible.**
> `media/publishing/01-folders.png`

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `Clones land in …\temco\source` and `Projects are made in …\temco\projects` |
| **If not** | a value you typed but did not save still shows as the old one. Press *Choose* or leave the field, then look again. If it says `Projects are made in …\temco`, the projects folder is still empty, and new projects will land beside the clones |

The third setting this guide depends on is **not** on that page. `temcoLearn.siteRepo` is the site clone; set it from the Site page with **Choose the Site Folder**. It defaults to `~/temco/temco-learn`. Check it now, because the whole right-hand half of the flow writes there.

## Step 2 — create a project

**Create a Project** (`temcoProjects.newProject`). Give it the name `T3000` and the version `1.0`, and leave the outputs ticked: *Website*, *PDF*, *Offline help* and *Search index*.

> **Screenshot — the create-project form, with the output ticks visible and a name typed in.**
> `media/publishing/02-create-project.png`

**Where the pages come from** is the choice that decides what exists once the form closes:

| Starting point | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Start empty** | records the project and nothing else. Its folder, `docs/help/registry.json` and one area come from **Create the Project's Documentation Folder** (`temcoDocs.createProjectFolder`) |
| **From a template** | writes a starter tree under the folder field — `docs/help/registry.json`, one area, two topics — named after the project, so `T3000` becomes `<projectsFolder>/t3000` |
| **From a folder** | cites a folder that already exists on this machine as the pages it reads; nothing is copied |
| **From a repository** | cites what the platform has already read — repositories, files and folders |
| **Import a document set** | converts Word, RTF, HTML, an HTML folder or a CHM **once** into `docs/` and a registry |

Either way, the project is recorded under the slug of its name (`T3000` becomes `t3000`), the sources it cites are recorded with it, and the outputs become its recipe. No source is ever written to. A project is a set of references, and its own folder holds only what the project itself writes.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `~/temco/projects/t3000/docs/help/registry.json`, and T3000 in the Library |
| **If not** | the folder is the slug of the name, so look in `~/temco/projects/` for what was actually made. A project created before you set the projects folder keeps the folder it already has; only new ones move |

The folder is added to the window so that its `docs/` shows in Explorer. That is expected, and nothing needs doing about it.

## Step 3 — write the pages

**New Page** (`temcoDocs.newPage`) with T3000 selected. It opens a **form** rather than a prompt: the place is already chosen from the row you were on, and the form shows the kind of page, the file it will write, and the body it starts from. The palette offers the kinds alongside it (*New Article*, *New Task*, *New Reference*, *New Troubleshooting*, *New Release Note*), and they differ only in their starter headings.

> **Screenshot — the Pages view and the New Page form side by side, with the kind, the target file and the starter body visible.**
> `media/publishing/03-pages.png`

| In the form | Decides |
|---|---|
| the kind | the starter headings: *Task* gives steps, *Reference* gives a table, *Troubleshooting* gives symptom, cause and fix |
| area and chapter | where the file is written, as `docs/<area>/<chapter>/<title>.md` |
| the title | the page's name in the navigation, in search and in the tree. It is **not** the file name until you accept |
| which source | asked only when the project cites more than one folder |

You are then in the editor. Each page is a Markdown file **and** a row in `docs/help/registry.json`. Three rules explain almost every surprise you will meet later:

| Rule | What it means |
|---|---|
| the **page id is its path** under `docs/`, without `.md` | `docs/t3000/commissioning/ports.md` has the id `t3000/commissioning/ports`, and the registry must name it exactly that |
| `ship: false` keeps a page out of the built site | a page can exist and be edited, and still never appear |
| `order` decides the position inside a chapter | two pages sharing a title or an `order` are a warning, not an error |

A page that is registered but whose file does not exist is an **error**, and the module reports it on refresh. That is what makes the `missing` rows in `Pages` mean something.

**Everything else you will want on a page** lives on its row. *Rename the Page Title*, *Move Up* and *Move Down* change where it sits; *Retire* keeps the file and drops it from the site; *Create the Missing Page File* fills a `missing` row; *New Folder…* (`temcoDocs.newChapter`) adds a chapter. Right-clicking a captured screenshot in `Needs You` offers *Attach the Screenshot to a Page…*.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | a Markdown file under `~/temco/projects/t3000/docs/<area>/`, and `registry.json` listing it |
| **If not** | the project has to be the **selected** project. The docs module reads the folders that project cites, not whatever folder happens to be open. A message about there being "no area to put a page in" means the project has no area yet: create a chapter, or start the project from a template |

Come back to this step whenever you have more to write. Nothing downstream notices until you build. Writing itself is [The editor](#the-editor), later in this guide.

## Step 4 — build the site

**Build the Site** (`temcoDocs.buildSite`), or *Build the Site* on the project page. It builds the project that is **selected**, reading the folders that project cites, so the folder does not have to be open in the window.

> **Screenshot — the Build Center after a build: the four counts, one card per output this project builds, and the newest run at the head of the log.**
> `media/publishing/04-build.png`

Two things can produce the site, and what is in the folder decides which one runs:

| In the project folder | What runs | Where the site lands |
|---|---|---|
| a `package.json` with `docs:site` or `docs:build` | that script, after `docs:registry` when the repository has one | wherever the script writes, commonly `dist/site` or docfx's `dist/docs` |
| neither | the **built-in generator** | `<project>/dist/site` |

Either way, the attempt is recorded in the Build Center (`temcoDocs.builds`), and every file the build wrote is recorded against it, so Publish & Releases can list real files rather than hopes.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `~/temco/projects/t3000/dist/site/index.html`, and a row in the Build Center (`temcoDocs.builds`) |
| **If not** | a project made here has no `package.json`, so the built-in generator writes the site, and the log says what it read. If your repository does have `docs:site` or `docs:build`, that script runs instead, and it may write `dist/docs` |

The exit code is never the verdict. What counts is a file that did not exist before the run and does now. A generator that exits 0 and writes nothing has failed; one that exits 1 after writing the site has not.

## Step 5 — build the project's own outputs (only for a repository)

Skip this step unless T3000 cites a real repository clone under `~/temco/source/`. **Temco Projects: Build** (`temcoProjects.buildProject`) takes the outputs you ticked and runs the repository's own script for each one, **once each**:

> **Screenshot — the terminal during a project build: `docs:registry`, then one script per ticked output, then the list of files it left behind.**
> `media/publishing/05-project-outputs.png`

| Ticked output | Script it looks for, in the repository |
|---|---|
| Website | `docs:site`, else `docs:build` |
| Offline help | `build:help:dry` |
| PDF | `build:help:dry`, else `docs:pdf` |
| Search index, AI index | nothing: no script here writes them |

`docs:registry` runs first whenever the repository has it, because it is what the other scripts read their structure from. The build then records every file that appeared during the run, whatever the exit codes said.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | the terminal run `docs:registry`, then the scripts above, and the log list the files they left behind |
| **If not** | the warning names the scripts it looked for. A repository with none of them runs nothing, which is the honest answer. A scaffolded project has no `package.json` at all, so step 4 is its build, and this step is not for it |

This is the step that produces a PDF or a `.chm` **for the docs module**: the copies it records and Publish & Releases lists, under their own output. The PDF that the website serves is a different file, made in step 7 from the site's own content.

## Step 6 — add the build to the site

**Add This Build to the Site** (`temcoLearn.addBuild`), or *Choose a build* on the Publishing page. The page that lists every build on disk is `temcoLearn.addBuilds`.

> **Screenshot — the version box, showing “project t3000” and the version field.**
> `media/publishing/06-add-build.png`

It finds every `dist/site` and `dist/docs` two folders below the window's folders, the projects folder and the working folder, and offers the ones that contain an `index.html` or, for a documentation project, an `index.md`. A Markdown build is added as content, so its pages become editable pages of the site; an HTML build is copied beside the catalog as it came. The box then names the project it will land in (`project t3000`) and asks one question: which version. Type `1.0`.

What happens with your answer:

| | |
|---|---|
| copies | the whole build folder into `<siteRepo>/public/imported/t3000/1.0/`. Adding the same version again **replaces** it |
| records | `<siteRepo>/content/t3000/site.json`, holding the title and the section. A new project defaults to `documentation` |
| catalogs | runs the site's own `npm run catalog`, which rewrites `public/catalog.json`, `public/search.json`, `public/content/` and the download bundles |
| opens | the site page for that project and version, so the result is one click away |

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `~/temco/temco-learn/public/imported/t3000/1.0/index.html`, `content/t3000/site.json`, and `t3000` with version `1.0` in `public/catalog.json` |
| **If not** | the build must contain an `index.html`. The catalog is rebuilt by this step, so a failure here means the clone has no `npm ci` yet, or has no `catalog` script |

The project's id is **its folder's name**, so a build in `<projectsFolder>/t3000/…` is always `t3000`, whatever its pages call themselves. Its section is `documentation` unless `site.json` says otherwise.

**Repeat this step every time you rebuild.** A build is copied as one version, so a changed site is a *new* version (`1.1`, `2.0`). Re-adding `1.0` replaces what is already there, which is what you want only when you are fixing that same version.

Adding a build is a local act. Nothing is published by this step.

## Step 7 — make the downloads

**Make the Downloads** (`temcoLearn.site.downloads`) is the step between *Add* and *Publish* on the Publishing page.

> **Screenshot — the Publishing page, with the five steps visible and the downloads step running.**
> `media/publishing/07-downloads.png`

It runs the site's own scripts in this order, and stops at the first real failure:

| Script | Makes | If it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `build:fast` | the catalog, the search index and the bundle the PDFs are printed from | fatal: nothing else can run |
| `pdf --strict` | one PDF per version, and one per Markdown page, mirrored into `public/pdf/` | fatal, usually because there is no browser: run `npx playwright install chromium` |
| `chm` | the help files and `public/download/manifest.json` | only a warning: a machine without `hhc.exe` still has a site |

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `public/pdf/t3000/1.0.pdf`, `public/download/manifest.json`, and `public/chm/…` only when the help compiler is on the machine |
| **If not** | the message names the step that failed: the site build, the PDFs (browser missing), or the help files (a warning, never fatal) |

These files are the one thing the deploy cannot make for you. The site's CI has no browser and no `hhc.exe`, so the PDF is printed here and committed, and the deploy **refuses to ship a version whose PDF is missing**. That refusal is the guard you will meet in step 9 if you skip this step.

**Come back to this step every time you finish step 6.** Each new version needs its own PDF, and the guard counts versions rather than projects.

## Step 8 — look at it before publishing

**Start the Site** (`temcoLearn.site.start`).

> **Screenshot — the site in a browser at localhost:1025: T3000's card under Documentation, and its page open.**
> `media/publishing/08-preview.png`

It builds the site first if `dist/index.html` is not there, then serves the built pages on one port: `temcoLearn.sitePort`, 1025 by default. What you are looking at is the **clone**, with the catalog that step 6 wrote. It is what a reader will see, minus the address.

| Look at | Because |
|---|---|
| the project's card under its section | the section came from `content/t3000/site.json`, so a wrong section is a one-line fix there |
| the version selector | every version you added is listed, and `1.0` should be there after step 6 |
| a page's navigation and content | an empty page means the Markdown is empty, not that the build failed |
| the downloads menu | it lists what step 7 committed, so an empty menu means the manifest is missing |
| search | this is the site's own index, and a page missing from it has `ship: false` |

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | `http://localhost:1025/` with T3000 under **Documentation**, and its page opening from the card |
| **If not** | the port is `temcoLearn.sitePort`; the site's log in the panel says whether the build or the server is the problem |

If a page is missing, it is either unregistered or marked `ship: false`, so go back to step 3 rather than rebuilding. **Stop the Site** (`temcoLearn.site.stop`) when you are finished. The open port, not the process, is the proof that it is running.

## Step 9 — publish

**Publish** (`temcoLearn.publish`) opens the publishing page: what changed, the steps of a publish in order, and the button. Press *Publish* there and confirm the message. **Publish Now** (`temcoLearn.publishNow`) does the same thing from the palette.

> **Screenshot — the Publishing page before the push: the changed paths, the five steps, and the Publish button.**
> `media/publishing/09-publish.png`

It does four things in order, and it stops at the first one that says no:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1 | runs the site's `catalog`, so that what is committed matches what the pages say |
| 2 | runs the site's **`guard`**, the same gate its CI runs, and refuses to commit when a version is missing a download |
| 3 | runs `git add --all` and makes one commit. The message defaults to `docs: publish the site (<date>)`, and you can replace it |
| 4 | runs `git push origin HEAD:main` |

Nothing is ever force-pushed. If `main` carries work this clone does not know about, the push is refused, the commit stays local, and a pull followed by another publish fast-forwards it.

Then the site's CI takes over. `pages.yml` runs its checks, builds the site, runs the same guard, and deploys `dist` to GitHub Pages at the address the log printed. A `v*` tag matching `package.json` instead packs the whole site as a zip for handing to somebody.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You should see** | in the clone, `git log -1 --stat` shows the commit and `git status` is clean. The log says `pushed <commit>`, the GitHub Actions run on `main` is green, and the address the log printed loads the page a minute later |
| **If not** | *the guard refused it* means step 7 was skipped for some version. The log names the missing file, and nothing was committed. *A refused push* means the clone is behind: pull, then publish again |

A publish carries everything waiting in the clone, not only the project you were working on. If that is not what you want, open the publishing page first: it lists the paths the commit would take before you press the button.

## The editor

You will spend most of your time here, so five minutes learning the surface saves months of hunting for a button.

A page opens in **Temco Editor**, the editor that owns `*.md`. It has one row of controls above the text, the text in the middle, and a **Page** container on the far right. The headings you see in the text are the page's prose; its title in the navigation comes from the registry, so renaming one does not rename the other.

> **Screenshot — a page open in Temco Editor, with the ribbon groups numbered: undo/redo, Style, Lists, marks, blocks, insert, `···`, and the right group.**
> `media/publishing/10-editor-ribbon.png`

### The ribbon, left to right

| Group | Holds |
|---|---|
| undo / redo | `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Y`. This is the page's own history, not git's |
| **Style** | paragraph or heading level, and the alignment of the block |
| **Lists** | bullet, numbered and task lists |
| **Marks** | bold `Ctrl+B` · italic `Ctrl+I` · underline `Ctrl+U` · strikethrough `Ctrl+Shift+X` · inline code `Ctrl+E` · highlight `Ctrl+Shift+H` |
| **Blocks** | quote `Ctrl+Shift+B` · code block `Ctrl+Alt+C` · horizontal rule · table |
| **Insert** | **Picture**, **Screenshot**, **Annotate** (only when a picture is selected), **Link to page** |
| `···` | everything the row has no space for, including *Open the source* (the plain Markdown, for a paste that must not be reformatted) and *Page properties* |
| right group | Find `Ctrl+F` · Outline `Ctrl+Alt+O` · **Read the page**, which toggles to *Edit the page* · Preview `Ctrl+Alt+P` · Diff `Ctrl+Alt+D` · Source · Page properties |

The same actions are in the editor title bar and in the right-click menu under **Temco Markdown**, so nothing is reachable only from the ribbon.

**Read the page** is the one people miss. It turns the editor into the rendered page, links and all, without opening Preview. Toggle it back when you want to edit again.

### Pictures

Click a picture once to select it. A ring appears, with drag handles at its edges. Drag a handle to resize, and the width is written into the Markdown title as `"w=480"`, so the built site and the offline help honour it too.

> **Screenshot — a picture selected in the editor, with the drag handles and the 25% · 50% · 75% · 100% · Delete menu visible.**
> `media/publishing/11-editor-picture.png`

With a picture selected, the inline menu offers the widths **25% · 50% · 75% · 100%** and **Delete**. `Ctrl+Z` puts a resize back. Nothing is written to the file until the editor saves, so an experiment costs you nothing until you decide to keep it.

**Screenshot** inserts a capture straight into the page's `media/` folder. A capture taken with no page open waits in **Needs You**, where *Attach the Screenshot to a Page…* files it later. **Annotate** draws on the selected picture, and one arrow on a screenshot is often worth a paragraph of text.

### The Page container, on the right

> **Screenshot — the Page container: the page's Outline, and the Draft the AI wrote beside the page's own text.**
> `media/publishing/12-editor-sidebar.png`

Two things live there. The **Outline** lists the page's headings, and clicking one jumps to it. The **Draft** appears when the AI module has written one. A draft is never applied by itself: you accept it, and it becomes a single undoable edit.

### Preview, Diff and Source

> **Screenshot — Preview of a page beside the editor, then the Diff view against HEAD.**
> `media/publishing/13-editor-preview.png`

| Control | Shows | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Preview** `Ctrl+Alt+P` | the page as the build renders it, in a tab of its own | you are checking a table, a callout or a picture width |
| **Diff with HEAD** `Ctrl+Alt+D` | what changed since the last commit | before publishing, especially on someone else's page |
| **Source** | the raw Markdown | a paste keeps coming out wrong |
| Page properties | a **read-only sheet** of the page's registry entry: title, area, chapter, order, `ship` and audience, plus the two ways to change it (the registry, or the page) | a page does not appear where you expect |

### Keyboard, all in one place

| Shortcut | Does |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+I` / `Ctrl+U` | bold / italic / underline |
| `Ctrl+Shift+X` | strikethrough |
| `Ctrl+E` | inline code |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H` | highlight |
| `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+Alt+C` | block quote / code block |
| `Ctrl+F` | find in the page |
| `Ctrl+Alt+O` | outline |
| `Ctrl+Alt+P` / `Ctrl+Alt+D` | preview / diff with HEAD |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+S` | save the page to disk |

## Running it again

After the first publish, the loop is shorter than the guide above, because the folders, the project and the site clone already exist. What you re-run depends on what changed:

| What changed | Build | Add | Downloads | Publish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pages only, same version | ✓ | ✓ (same version — it replaces) | ✓ | ✓ |
| pages, and this is a new release | ✓ | ✓ (new version) | ✓ | ✓ |
| nothing — you only want to push someone else's changes | — | — | — | ✓ |
| the site's own code or content | — | — | — | ✓ |

The four commands, in order:

```text
Temco Docs:    Build the Site                  temcoDocs.buildSite
Temco Learn:   Add This Build to the Site      temcoLearn.addBuild
Temco Learn:   Make the Downloads              temcoLearn.site.downloads
Temco Learn:   Publish                         temcoLearn.publish
```

Two habits save the most time. **Add a new version for a new release**, because re-adding the same version replaces it and readers lose the old one. And **redo the downloads every time you add a version**, because the guard counts versions, so a new version without its PDF blocks the publish rather than the deploy.

## The same flow, as files: T3000

```text
~/temco/projects/t3000/                   the project, and only the project
├── docs/help/registry.json               the page registry
├── docs/commissioning/*.md               your pages
└── dist/site/index.html                  step 4: the site build

~/temco/temco-learn/                      the site clone
├── content/t3000/site.json               step 6: the title and the section
├── public/imported/t3000/1.0/index.html  step 6: the build's own pages
├── public/pdf/t3000/1.0.pdf              step 7: the whole-guide PDF
├── public/chm/t3000/1.0.chm              step 7: the help file, when it compiles
├── public/download/manifest.json         step 7: what the download menu offers
├── public/catalog.json                   what the site reads, rewritten by steps 6 and 9
└── dist/                                 step 9: what CI deploys
```

## What the files look like

Three files carry the whole arrangement. Knowing their shape lets you tell a wrong page from a wrong build without guessing.

**`~/temco/projects/t3000/docs/help/registry.json`** is written by the create flow and by every page you add. It is the only list of pages; nothing else decides what exists.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "areas": { "t3000": { "title": "t3000", "audience": "user", "noindex": false } },
  "pages": {
    "t3000/commissioning/ports": {
      "title": "Ports and wiring",
      "area": "t3000", "chapter": "commissioning", "order": 10,
      "audience": "user", "ship": true, "owner": "docs"
    }
  }
}
```

`ship: false` leaves a page out of the built site, and `order` decides its place inside the chapter. The key (`t3000/commissioning/ports`) must equal the file's path under `docs/`, or the page counts as missing.

**`~/temco/temco-learn/content/t3000/site.json`** is written once by step 6 and kept after that. It is how the site names the project and files it under a section.

```json
{ "title": "T3000", "section": "documentation" }
```

Add `"summary"` for the sentence shown on the project's card, and change `"section"` to move the whole project to another category.

**`~/temco/temco-learn/public/catalog.json`** is generated and never edited. Every row is either a Markdown page the site owns or an imported page your build wrote, in one reading order.

```json
{ "projects": [ { "id": "t3000", "title": "T3000", "section": "documentation",
                  "versions": [ { "version": "1.0",
                                  "pages": [ { "href": "index.html", "title": "T3000", "kind": "build" } ] } ] } ] }
```

That `"kind": "build"` is the giveaway: the page came from your build rather than from the site's own content. If it is missing after step 6, the catalog did not run.

## Reference: what the outputs mean

The ticks on a project say what it is meant to produce, and one build is meant to produce all of them.

| Output | Is | Which script runs, in your repository |
|---|---|---|
| Website | static pages for Temco Learn | `docs:site`, else `docs:build`, else the built-in generator |
| PDF | one document in a printed layout | `build:help:dry`, else `docs:pdf` |
| Offline help | the `.chm` | `build:help:dry` |
| Search index | the index the site loads | none here: the site builds it with `npm run search` |
| AI index | embeddings, kept on this machine only | none here: nothing is uploaded |

A build writes inside your project folder. The site goes to `dist/site` (or `dist/docs`, when a repository's own generator wrote it), and the PDF and the `.chm` go wherever your scripts put them, commonly `dist/` or a `HelpDocs` folder beside the repository. Every file a build leaves behind is recorded against it, so the Builds and Downloads pages can list it.

## Two things worth doing on purpose

A guard nobody has watched refuse is a guard nobody can trust.

| Try this | You should see |
|---|---|
| Delete `public/pdf/t3000/1.0.pdf`, then publish | the publish **stops before committing** and names the missing file. Run *Make the Downloads* and publish again, and it goes through |
| Rename the project's page title, rebuild, then add the build again as `1.1` | version `1.1` lands under `t3000`: `content/` still holds one folder, and the catalog lists one project with two versions |

## When a step goes wrong

| Step | What you see | What it usually is | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | the build is not in the list to add | there is no `index.html` or `index.md` in it, or it sits more than two folders below a root | the folder itself. The roots are the window's folders, the projects folder and the working folder |
| 6 | adding refuses | the site clone is not where `temcoLearn.siteRepo` says | that setting, and whether the folder has `package.json` and `content/sections.json` |
| 6, 9 | the catalog did not run | there is no `npm ci` in the clone, or no `catalog` script | the site log |
| 9 | publishing refuses | the site's guard: a version has no committed PDF | the guard lines in the log |
| 9 | publishing pushes, but the site looks unchanged | the commit carried nothing, because the clone matched the last publish | `git log` and `git status` in the clone |
| 6 | the site page is wrong after a rebuild | the build was rebuilt but never added again as a new version | `public/catalog.json` and `public/imported/` |

## Beyond the flow

A project can do more than publish. None of the following is needed to get a page live, and all of it is available once you have one.

### Bringing in material that already exists

A **source** is where pages are written from: a repository, a folder, or a document. There are two doors to the same result: the project's own page (`temcoProjects.editProject`), or the `Pages` view title → **Add a Source** (`temcoProjects.addSource`, the plug beside `＋`).

If you already have a `docs/` folder, create the project with **From existing files** and choose that folder or file. A folder that already has `docs/help/registry.json` is cited as it stands, and nothing is copied. Anything else (Markdown, HTML, Word `.docx`, or a compiled `.chm`) is converted **once** into `docs/` and a registry, so from then on it is ordinary pages. A source is recorded once and can be cited by more than one project, and nothing is ever written back to it.

### Checking before you build

**Validate** (`temcoDocs.validate`) answers one question: would a reader find a broken link, a missing page, or a page nobody registered? It reports in the Problems panel. A build does not fail on what it finds; the published site simply contains it. So run it before step 4.

### Releasing a build locally

**Publish** on the Publish & Releases page (`temcoDocs.publishRelease`) is not publishing to the site. It copies the last build's artifacts into the application's own storage, at `published/<project>/<version>` with a manifest, behind a confirmation that names the version, the destination and the file count. `temcoDocs.openPublished` opens that copy, `temcoDocs.servePublished` serves it and `temcoDocs.stopServing` stops it. Use it to hand a build to somebody, or to keep a version that will not change. Nothing is pushed anywhere.

### Exporting

**Export…** (`temcoDocs.export`) opens the Exports page, which tells you what you get before you get it. Every export writes into the project's `dist/`, and the notification offers *Show in Folder*.

> **Screenshot — the Exports page: the four shapes, each saying what is inside it and where it lands.**
> `media/publishing/14-exports.png`

| Shape | Command | You get |
|---|---|---|
| the site, as a zip | `temcoDocs.exportSite` | `index.html`, `assets/site.css`, every page and each page's `media/`: the finished website before it is served from anywhere |
| one page, as one file | `temcoDocs.exportPage` | a single `.html` with the stylesheet inlined and every picture a `data:` URI, so it opens on a machine that has never seen the project |
| one page, as a Word document | `temcoDocs.exportDocx` | a `.docx` with headings, lists, tables and the pictures embedded: the format reviewers ask for |
| the pages, as a Markdown bundle | `temcoDocs.exportMarkdown` | every `.md`, each folder's `media/` and `registry.json`: the sources, for another tool or for an archive |

Nothing is uploaded. A page with very large pictures makes a very large single file, so export the site as a zip when the pictures matter more than the convenience.

### Translating a page

**Translate This Page…** (`temcoDocs.translatePage`) writes the translation **beside** the page, never over it: `docs/guide/setup.md` becomes `docs/guide/setup.de.md`.

> **Screenshot — the language picker, and the translated sibling page open beside the original.**
> `media/publishing/15-translate.png`

- Only the prose is translated. Code fences, inline code, table rules, link targets, image paths, front matter and the leading `#`, `-` and `>` markers are preserved byte for byte, so a translated page still builds, still links and still shows its pictures.
- **Once**: an Azure AI Translator resource. Its key goes into the OS keychain with **Set the Translator Key** (`temcoDocs.setTranslatorKey`), and the endpoint and region are the settings `temcoDocs.translator.endpoint` and `temcoDocs.translator.region`.
- **One request per page**, sent only when you run the command. Nothing is translated in the background.
- **Errors**: `401` means a key that was refused, `403` a key without a Translator resource (check the region), and `429` the free tier's rate limit. A page that is all code only says there is no prose, and costs nothing. Translating again asks before replacing the sibling file.
- A translation is an ordinary page. The registry and the review flow treat it like any other file, and a build includes it. Listing it in a language menu on the site is a registry decision, not the translator's.

## When something else goes wrong

The table above covers the publishing pipeline. These are the rest:

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Build the Site says *no `docs:site` (or `docs:build`) script* | the project has a `package.json` but no site script | add one, or delete the `package.json` so the built-in generator takes over |
| Build the Site says *has no pages marked for publishing* | no page is registered for the site, or every registered page is missing its file | open `Pages`, look for `missing` rows, and use **Create the Missing Page File** |
| the site builds but a page is empty | the page is registered and its file exists, but the Markdown is empty | write it, or **Retire the Page** |
| a page is missing from the published site | it is not registered, or it is not marked for the site | `Pages` → `…` → **Open Registry** |
| an export says *has no pages to export* | no registered page has a file yet | create or generate the pages first |
| a single-file page shows a broken picture | the picture's path in the Markdown is wrong, or it is not under the page's `media/` | fix the reference, because the same link is broken on the site |
| the editor shows raw Markdown | the file opened as text | in `Pages`, right-click the page → **Open the Page**; or in Explorer, **Reopen Editor With…** → **Temco Editor** |
| a picture is full width on the web but small in the editor | the page is older than the width support | reselect the picture, drag a handle, save |
| **The Temco Editor surface is not built** — `markdown.js`, `markdown.css` are missing | the window is running compiled extension-host code whose webview bundle was never built, or was removed by a build that cleans `out/` | `npm run compile-temco` from the repository root, then **Developer: Reload Window**. A plain `npm run compile` stops before the webviews when an earlier check fails, so the application compiles and its pages still have no surface |

The output explains itself: **View → Output → `Temco Docs`**. Every build, publish, export and generator decision is written there, with the path it used.

## Appendix — every button, one page

Every control the platform puts on screen, grouped by where it lives. The command id beside each one runs the same action from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). Every id here was checked against the manifests, so if a row is in this table, the command exists.
