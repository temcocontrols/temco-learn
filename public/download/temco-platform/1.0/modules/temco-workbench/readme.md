title: "`temco-workbench`"
order: 10
---

The application's own surfaces. It is the only module that is not a domain: it owns the **Library** (the index of what every module has), the **dashboard**, the **needs page**, and the three layout decisions that come with them — which side panel and which tab open at startup, and which sidebar section comes forward when the project changes.

| | |
|---|---|
| Folder | `extensions/temco-workbench` |
| Extension id | `temcocontrols.temco-workbench` |
| Namespace | `temcoWorkbench` |
| State | active |
| View | **Library** (`temcoWorkbench.library`), contributed into the `temco` activity-bar container that the documentation module declares |
| Pages | `temcoWorkbench.overview` (the dashboard), `temcoWorkbench.activity` (what the platform recorded), `temcoWorkbench.openNeeds` (what wants a person), `temcoWorkbench.welcome` (the page a new window opens on) |
| Setting | `temcoWorkbench.start.open` — `welcome` · `project` · `page` · `home` · `none` (default `welcome`) · `temcoWorkbench.start.panel` — the left panel's item revealed at startup (default `temcoDashboard`) · `temcoWorkbench.updateChannel` and the `branding` · `ai` · `publishing` keys the Settings pages write |
| Requires | `temco-store`, `temco-ui`, `temco-repositories`, `temco-docs` |
| Required by | `temco-docs` — nothing; the dependency runs one way, and the workbench reads the documentation module's model |

## Responsibilities, one file each

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/extension.ts` | activation: builds the three surfaces, wires their signals, and decides the first tab |
| `src/sidebar.ts` | the side-bar groups that are not a data view — Platform, Needs Work, Site, Delivery, Profile, Learn, Support — registered here because a container cannot declare its order in the activity bar |
| `src/dashboard.ts` | the dashboard's two pages: **Overview** (what the platform holds, what is waiting, the pipeline, the activity) and **Recent Activity** |
| `src/helpPages.ts` | Welcome, Help, Keyboard Shortcuts, Logs, Report an Issue, About — and the one preference Welcome carries |
| `src/settingsPages.ts` | the five settings pages (General, Modules, Branding, AI Runtime, Publishing). Every row is a declared setting, so a write lands in `settings.json` and the window obeys it at once; the page reads the configuration back and never keeps a value of its own |
| `src/needsPage.ts` | what wants a person, gathered from every module into one list with the reason and where the fix is |
| `src/learnPages.ts` | Temco Learn as a reader sees it: Home, T3000, an article, Downloads, Learning Paths |
| `src/surface.ts` | the page view types |
| `src/docs.ts` · `src/store.ts` · `src/ui.ts` · `src/repositories.ts` · `src/aiModule.ts` | what it reads of the documentation module, the store, the UI rules, the repository scripts and the AI — each in one file, because an extension cannot import another extension's sources |

## Commands

`temcoWorkbench.home` (the dashboard) · `temcoWorkbench.openNeeds` (the needs page) · `temcoWorkbench.welcome` (the welcome page) · `temcoWorkbench.toggleWelcomeStartup` (the checkbox in its footer, which writes `temcoWorkbench.start.open`) · `temcoWorkbench.settings` (the settings page) · `temcoWorkbench.setStartOpen` (the one command a row on it runs) · `temcoWorkbench.help` (the help page). Everything the Library's rows and menus do is another module's command — the menus are here, the work is not.

## What the pages refuse to invent

The mock has surfaces whose content this product cannot honestly produce, and none of them were copied across:

| Mock page | Here |
|---|---|
| Help › Keyboard Shortcuts, Help › Logs | Not built. VS Code publishes neither list to an extension, and a page that guessed would be a page that lies. The Help page carries what is real instead: the build, the module register, the platform string, and the issue tracker. |
| Workspaces | Removed. A workspace was the mock's folder-above-the-project level, drawn over a fixed sample (`T3000`, `T3-BACnet`, …) with counts nothing recorded, and a “create” that wrote only into the window. The product's unit is the **project**, which the catalog holds; its sources are the folders, and New Project is the wizard the sample stood in for. |
| Devices, I/O Studio, BACnet, Network, SQL Studio | Not built. Those modules are reserved — a page over a module that does not exist would be a mock inside the product. |

## One home: Welcome, the VS Code way

A window that opens on a page you did not ask for has to earn it, so the welcome page carries only what a person can act on: six ways in (each a button running another module's command), three walkthroughs that list their steps instead of claiming progress, and a footer whose single checkbox writes the setting that decides the first tab. There is no picture of the product on it.

The arrangement is VS Code's, deliberately:

- **Welcome is the first tab.** `start.open` defaults to `welcome`, so a launch answers "what is this and where do I begin" before it shows any work.
- **The page owns the switch.** Its footer checkbox *Show the welcome page at startup* writes `temcoWorkbench.start.open` — there is no second place to turn it off, and the checkbox and the setting cannot disagree.
- **Help ▸ Welcome brings it back**, as does the palette, every time.
- **The Dashboard is not a second home.** It is the activity-bar container you go to *after* Welcome — Overview (what the platform holds and what is waiting), Recent Activity, Needs Work. VS Code's equivalent is Explorer: state you click into, never a page that opens itself beside the welcome page.

The two only ever fought because either could be the first tab. Now one is the default and the other is a click, and each has one question: Welcome asks *where do I start*, the Overview asks *what is in it and what needs me*. With the checkbox off the chain never ends at the welcome page — `project` → the page you were last on → the overview — so turning it off means what it says; an empty window gets the overview, which has its own empty state and a *New Project* button. **Coverage & Health** is gone as a third dashboard page: the documentation module draws that report from the same registry with the same figures, so the Overview's Knowledge card links to it instead of duplicating it.

## Where a settings page writes

Every row on the five Settings pages is a declared setting, so everything a page decides is in the profile's `settings.json`:

| Page | Keys |
|---|---|
| General | `workbench.colorTheme` · `temcoWorkbench.start.panel` · `workbench.breadcrumbs.enabled` · `telemetry.telemetryLevel` · `temcoWorkbench.updateChannel` |
| Modules | none — the rows describe what is loaded, and every button runs another module's command |
| Branding | `temcoWorkbench.branding.productName` · `.accent` — the name the pages draw, and the accent written into `workbench.colorCustomizations` |
| AI Runtime | `temcoAi.model` · `.runtime` · `.modelFolder` · `.allowUnpinned` · `.idleMinutes` · `.serverPort` · `.serverIdleMinutes` · `.platformApi` — the AI module's own keys, so the page writes exactly what that module reads |
| Publishing | `temcoWorkbench.publishing.site` · `.path` · `.channel` · `.website` · `.pdf` · `.offlineHelp` · `.searchIndex` · `.aiIndex` |

Two facts are not settings and are not written there: **when a row last changed** and **what Test Connection last read back**. Both are kept in the profile's own state rather than in the file, because they record what happened rather than what a person chose. `Restore Defaults` removes the value instead of writing a copy of today's default, so the manifest stays the only place a default is stated.

## Boundary rules

- **The Library is an index, not a domain.** It shows what the store recorded and what the documentation module published; it owns no data of its own and keeps no copy.
- **A row's action belongs to the module that owns the thing.** *Read a source* is `temcoRepositories.readSource`, *Build the project* is `temcoProjects.buildProject`, a page's *Rename* is `temcoDocs.renamePage`. The Library names them; it never re-implements one.
- **Nothing here writes.** The only state it changes is the project being worked on, and that is the store's own command.
- **The AI is optional for it too.** The Library's AI row appears only when that module is installed — asked, never assumed.
- **The Workspace is not its view.** The tree of pages is the documentation module's own view; the workbench only *brings it forward* by id when the project changes.
